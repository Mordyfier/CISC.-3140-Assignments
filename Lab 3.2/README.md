### Lab 3.2

#### JS Event Listeners


This task involves practice working with event listener to create effects that react in real time to user input.

For this exercise, I chose the Luhn Algorithm, which allows for the validation of credit card numbers. The user inputs the credit number (samples of a valid and an invalid number are provided). Upon clicking 'Check', the page will output whether the number satisfies the Luhn Algorithm.
