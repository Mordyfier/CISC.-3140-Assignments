### Labs 4.2 and 4.3

#### Creating a server; Creating a Web Page and Deployment


Due to time constraints (3 days to learn HTML/CSS/JS/Node.js/Express.js/postgreSQL + deployment from literally nothing is an incredibly tall order) I did not quite manage to implement and deploy a Server API/REST API that would serve the data from my database.

That said, what I do have is a fully functional (albeit the functions leave a lot to be desired - again, time) Node.js server coupled with Express.js for middlewares, routing, and templating (an attempt was made at proper MVC structure) for serving html webpages (prepared with the help of the pug templating package) to the user.

The app, along with its database is deployed to heroku at ## https://moviedb-3140.herokuapp.com/
