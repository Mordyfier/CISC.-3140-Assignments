### Lab 2.1

##### Centralized VCS practice with SVN

Similar to Lab 1.2 - Show the process for working with an SVN repository from the terminal.

* Create a new SVN repository.
* Add a new file to be tracked by the repository, commit changes, check in the file.
* Modify the file (to create a versioning diff), commit the changes.
* Upload the plaintext file (called e.g. session.log) to the repository.
* Also include a reference sheet that shows a summarized comparison of Git versus Subversion commands for each action:

| | Git | Subversion |
|---|---|---|
|Documentation| https://git-scm.com/doc  | https://svnbook.red-bean.com |
|Creating a new repository| git create | subversion new |
