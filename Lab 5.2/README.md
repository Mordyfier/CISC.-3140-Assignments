 ## Lab 5.2
 
 ### Web Page with CSS Styling
 
 Prepare a webpage with CSS styling. You can continue with the frontend portion you started in the previous lab assignment, or create something else such as an online resume, **or the table described in task 5.1**. It is up to you what content you want to display. You will be practicing writing CSS rules.
